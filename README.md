# Description of the assignment

This assignment is based on a map called Direct Strike in the game of Starcraft2. Basically, building endless army to destroy enemies for advantages.

# Instructions

Choose a race, protoss or terran to play against another human. Upgrade attributes for those air units generates every a few seconds if there is supply avaialbe. Resources are automatically generating and can be also gained by destroy enemies.
# How it works

The score is the final figure for victory, but on the arena of justice, who shall be the last warrior of Aiur or the great terran?

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
As used to be a part time pro esport player, every esport game made my life so meaningful. So by desigining this UI gives me chance to explore the games into a complete different angle.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
